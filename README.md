# Weather Prediction Analytics

> **Team project** for DATA 226 (Big Data and Warehouse), San José State University, with Divija Puli. 
>
> **My role:** built the dbt layer (staging and analytics models, four weather metrics, data tests, and snapshot) and the Preset dashboard. Divija built the Airflow ETL and the dbt scheduling in Airflow.

This project collects daily weather data for Portland and Austin using the Open-Meteo API, loads it into Snowflake through Airflow, transforms it with dbt, and visualizes the results in Preset.

## Architecture

Open-Meteo API → Airflow ETL → Snowflake RAW → dbt transformations → Preset dashboard

## Cities

- Portland, Oregon: 45.5234, -122.6762
- Austin, Texas: 30.2672, -97.7431

The Airflow pipeline retrieves the previous 60 days of weather data for both cities.

## Technologies

- Docker
- Apache Airflow
- PostgreSQL
- Snowflake
- dbt
- Preset
- Open-Meteo API

## Snowflake Raw Table

`DEMO_DB.RAW.WEATHER_TEMPERATURE`

Columns:

- `CITY`
- `LATITUDE`
- `LONGITUDE`
- `DATE`
- `TEMP_MAX`
- `TEMP_MIN`
- `PRECIPITATION`
- `WEATHER_CODE`

## dbt Output Objects

- `DEMO_DB.ANALYTICS.STG_WEATHER`
- `DEMO_DB.ANALYTICS.WEATHER_METRICS`
- `DEMO_DB.ANALYTICS.WEATHER_SNAPSHOT`

The analytics model calculates:

- Seven-day moving average temperature
- Temperature anomaly
- Seven-day rolling rainfall
- Dry spell length

## Airflow DAGs

### WeatherTemperatureETL

This DAG:

1. Extracts weather data from Open-Meteo
2. Transforms the API response into rows
3. Loads the data into Snowflake

The load uses `BEGIN`, `DELETE`, `INSERT`, and `COMMIT`. If an error occurs, the transaction is rolled back.

### WeatherAnalyticsDBT

This DAG runs after the ETL DAG and executes:

1. `dbt run`
2. `dbt test`
3. `dbt snapshot`

The workflow is:

`WeatherTemperatureETL → dbt run → dbt test → dbt snapshot`

## Airflow Configuration

The project uses:

- Airflow connection: `snowflake_conn`
- Airflow Variable: `weather_cities`

The dbt project is mounted inside the Airflow container at:

`/opt/airflow/dbt`

The Airflow Web UI is available at:

`http://localhost:8081`

## Data Quality

The dbt project includes tests for:

- Non-negative rainfall
- Maximum temperature above minimum temperature
- Unique city and date combinations
- Required fields not being null

The dbt snapshot tracks historical changes to weather records.

## Dashboard

Built in Preset (hosted Apache Superset) on `DEMO_DB.ANALYTICS.WEATHER_METRICS`, the table created by dbt.

**Charts**
- Daily Temperature vs 7-Day Moving Average
- Daily Temperature Anomaly by City
- Daily and 7-Day Rolling Rainfall by City
- Dry Spell Length by City

**Filters:** City and Date range. Metrics are precomputed in dbt, so filters change what is shown, not how the metrics are calculated.

Screenshots of each chart are in the [screenshots](screenshots/) folder. The dashboard is in a private Preset workspace, so screenshots are included instead of a link.

## Security

Private keys, passwords, passphrases, and local environment files are excluded from the repository. Snowflake access is configured through Airflow connections and dbt environment variables.
